Welcome to ataraxis-micro-controller API documentation page
===========================================================

ataraxis-micro-controller is a C++ library for Arduino and Teensy microcontrollers that provides the framework for
integrating custom hardware modules with a centralized PC control interface.

This library is part of the broader 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun (NeuroAI) lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. It has a companion library written in
Python, `ataraxis-communication-interface <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-communication-interface>`_, that
provides the PC interface for controlling the microcontroller hardware modules implemented via this library.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
`ataraxis-micro-controller GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller>`_.
