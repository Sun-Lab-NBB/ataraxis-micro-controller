Welcome to the SerializedTransferProtocol_Microcontroller Documentation
========================================================================

The SerializedTransferProtocol_Microcontroller (STP_M) library is a C++ library that is part of the broader
multiplatform SerializedTransferProtocol (STP) project. The STP project provides a fast and reliable way of serializing
and transferring data between different platforms, targeting realtime applications, such as scientific experiments. This
particular implementation is designed specifically for Microcontroller platforms, such as Arduino and Teensy boards.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples: `SerializedTransferProtocol_Microcontroller
