# This file provides configurations for tox-based project automation. Generally, this project uses tox similar to how
# some other projects use build-systems. For microcontroller-targeted projects, most development functionality is
# realized through Platformio CLI, which works very similar to Tox. Currently, tox is only used to build API
# documentation from source files.

# Base tox configurations. Note, the 'envlist' will run in the listed order whenever 'tox' is used without an -e
# specifier.

# This forces tox to create a 'sterile' environment into which the project with all dependencies is installed prior to
# running the requested tasks, isolating the process from the rest of the system. This is almost always the desired
# runtime mode.

# Note: since doxygen is not pip-installable, it has to be installed and made available system-wide for this task to
# succeed. Consult https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html for guidance. Uses '-j auto' to parallelize the build
# process and '-v' to make it verbose.
